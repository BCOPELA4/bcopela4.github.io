     <h2>Our Method</h2><br>
   SmoochBox Open implements a business model that is designed to truly engage the client.  We move beyond the essentials that are typically offered to new clients at the leading competitors. Our firm will not only provide our clients with a no cost consultation but we will actually start the project.<br><br> 

     <h2>Developing Your Project Together</h2><br>
   Typically the amount of the project that we shall complete may vary based upon the overall depth and complexity of the project. However, we would suggest no less than 25% of the projects' completion is a realistic projection unless a previous relationship has been established. Repeat customers are granted a bit more leniency as trust has been established across multiple projects over a period of time. After starting a project the client has the opportunity to review and then either accept or decline the completed work.<br><br> 

    <h2>What's Next?</h2><br>
   Should the client desire to continue with our firm revsions and improvements may be made to the work or if it is satisfactory to the client we shall move to the next stage of production. At this point, the client is only responsible for covering the invoice for the work that has been completed. It's really that simple!<br>

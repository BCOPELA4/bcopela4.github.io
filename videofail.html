     <h2>Creativity Begets Laughter</h2><br>
   Building a tech company can be challenging. Behind the scences there are lots of triumphs and fails. Our firm shall be creating fun, energetic, and even goofy material to promote our services as well as those of our clients.<br><br> 
    
   <h2>Knowing When To Laugh</h2><br> 
   The video included within this page shows a last minute effort to create an extemporaneous movie that would demonstrate our commitment toward working effortlessly to get the job done. Unfortunately, there were three major fails in this video:<br><br> 

<br>

     <h2>One...</h2><br>
   I forgot to mention that we are working around the clock like robots - even though that should become obvious upon viewing the video.<br><br> 

    <h2>Two...</h2><br>
   The video was last minute so it did not turn out as planned.<br><br>

   <h2>Three...</h2><br>
   The ending somewhat 'trips up' the entire message. Enjoy!<br>
